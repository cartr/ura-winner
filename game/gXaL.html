<p style="line-height: 16px;">The following is an abridged excerpt from a recent local news story.</p>

<blockquote>
Surprise and mild amusement gripped the residents of Examination Island today as local police discovered a crate containing hundreds of rubber ducks at the bottom of Opportunity Bay.<br><br>
Police say they believe the crate fell out of a delivery truck during the Achievement Bridge disaster last month. No additional charges related to the ducks have been filed.<br><br>
Local fisherman Hardy Stevens says he's happy the source of the ducks has finally been located. "I'd been wondering where all those little guys came from; almost thought it was the PVC bait I was using!"<br><br>
The Environmental Committee reminds all residents to dispose of their trash in appropriate receptacles, not by dumping it into bodies of water.
