<p>The following is a paragraph from a draft of a student's persuasive essay about transportation. It contains errors.</p>

<blockquote>
<em>[...]</em><br/>
Another reason why you should not drive a car is, that it is bad for the environment.
A report by <span id="secretlink">National Geographic</span> said, "Vehicles are Americaâ€™s biggest air quality compromisers, producing about one-third of all U.S. air pollution."
In other words, driving a car produces smoke that can make it hard for Americans to breathe.
Air pollution can lead to lung cancer, death and other illnesses.
I think this is a very important reason not to drive cars.
<br/><em>[...]</em>

        <div class="question">
            <strong>Q1:</strong>
            
Which of the following issues weakens the argument made in this paragraph? (Select the most correct answer.)

            
            
                <a href="F8j4.html" class="answer">
                    <img src="resp_a.png" />
                    National Geographic is not a primary source for information about air pollution.
                </a>
            
            
        

            
            
                <a href="A1Yl.html" class="answer">
                    <img src="resp_b.png" />
                    The third sentence implies that pollution only affects Americans, not people from other countries.
                </a>
            
            
        

            
            
                <a href="d2Ij.html" class="answer">
                    <img src="resp_c.png" />
                    The assertion made in the fourth sentence is not supported by the quote.
                </a>
            
            
        

            
            
                <a href="tCja.html" class="answer">
                    <img src="resp_d.png" />
                    "I think" is not an appropriate phrase to use in the final sentence.
                </a>
