<p>The following is a paragraph from a draft of a student's persuasive essay about transportation. It contains errors.</p>

<blockquote>
<em>[...]</em><br/>
Another reason why you should not drive a car is, that it is bad for the environment.
A report by <span id="secretlink">National Geographic</span> said, "Vehicles are bad, and you should feel bad if you drive one."
In other words, driving a car isn't a good idea.
You should feel bad if you drive a car.
You should use public transit instead of driving a car.
You should take the subway instead of driving a car.
You should stay home instead of driving a car.
I think this is a very important reason not to drive cars.
<br/><em>[...]</em>

                    National Geographic is not a primary source for information about air pollution.

                    The third sentence implies that pollution only affects Americans, not people from other countries.

                    "I think" is not an appropriate phrase to use in the final sentence.
