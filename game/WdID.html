<p>The following is a paragraph from a draft of a student's persuasive essay about transportation. It contains errors.</p>

<blockquote>
<em>[...]</em><br/>
Another reason why you should not drive a car is, that it is bad for the environment.
A report by <span id="secretlink">National Geographic</span> said, "Vehicles are Americaâ€™s biggest air quality compromisers, producing about one-third of all U.S. air pollution."
In other words, driving a car produces smoke that can make it hard for Americans to breathe.
Air pollution can lead to lung cancer, death and other illnesses.
I think this is a very important reason not to drive cars.

                    National Geographic is not a primary source for information about air pollution.

                    The third sentence implies that pollution only affects Americans, not people from other countries.
