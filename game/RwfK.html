<p>On your way out of the bookstore, you notice a man standing in the alley. He motions for you to come over.</p>
<p>"Psst, hey kid, got a minute?"</p>


<p>You suppose there's nothing wrong with talking to random people in alleys, and you do indeed have a minute, so you walk toward him.</p>


<p>"Listen, all that stuff about context and emotion and critical reading? It's all bunk. Nine times outta ten, the answer to a URA reading question is something that's <em>clearly spelled out in the text</em> they give you. Just read it over and find a line you can point at to justify your answer. Everything else is a trap designed to make sure there's enough variance in the score distribution."</p>


<p>Variance? Distribution?</p>
<p>"Wouldn't want too many people getting perfect scores, in other words."</p>


<p>You thank the man for his time and head home to ruminate on all the advice you heard today.</p>
