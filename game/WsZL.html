<p>You head to the cash register to pay for your new book. The cashier asks what brings you to town, and you respond that you're studying for the URA. You ask if she has any advice for the English section.</p>

<p>"But I've heard the most important thing is to read <em>critically</em>. You have to read <em>between</em> the lines and look at not just what the author is directly telling you, but what they're telling you by omission."</p>
<p>By omission?, you ask.</p>
