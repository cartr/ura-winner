<h2>About the Undergraduate Readiness Assessment</h2>

<p>The URA is a 270-minute exam consisting of three sections.</p>

<p>The <strong>English</strong> section will evaluate your ability to read, interpret, and write news articles, poetry, fictional stories, essays, and reports. You should also be prepared to find errors in drafts written by students.</p>

<p>The <strong>Mathematics</strong> section will evaluate your ability to understand and manipulate numbers, algebraic expressions, geometric constructions, and proofs. You will be allowed to use an approved graphing calculator on this section.</p>

<p>The <strong>Social Studies</strong> section will evaluate your comprehension of the principles, traditions, and practices that govern human society. You may be asked to interpret major historical events, but specific knowledge of United States history is not required.</p>

<p>The ordering of these sections, as well as the exact timing of breaks, varies from sitting to sitting. For more details, contact the school at which you will be taking the exam.</p>
