          <h2>English: Reading and Literature</h2>
        
        
<p>Where better to learn about the English language than the local bookstore? And what better bookstore than the Examination Island City Bookstore?</p>
<p>As you enter the store, you see shelves filled with different types of books. In one section, there's a selection of romance novels. In another, self-help guides. You wonder what type of book would best help you prepare for the Undergraduate Readiness Assessment.</p>
<p>You've heard that grammar and style manuals can be useful resources. The stories used on the exam often contain references to classic works. It probably wouldn't be a bad idea to read a poetry anthology, too; even if you can't always grasp the deeper meaning, it's at least helpful to get familiar with common meters and rhyme schemes. A good mystery novel could help recharge your batteries after a long study session. And the "test prep" section is always pretty popular this time of year.</p>
<p>You conclude that it's probably best to read a wide variety of books. Really, the important thing is that you're reading at all.</p>
