<p>The Examination Island Science Museum has one exhibit that particularly catches your eye.</p>
<p>It's a series of murals along one wall of the building. In the first, a caveman bangs two rocks together to create a fire. In another, a Roman general watches water flow through a series of conduits. "Some say they're what makes us who we are," a sign says. "Others merely believe they are essential to the success of the human race. Still, no one can argue their Earth-shattering importance."</p>
<p>The murals continue down a hallway; you follow them. A construction worker carves up the sidewalk with a jackhammer. Alexander Graham Bell speaks into an early telephone. A toddler proudly holds up a fork.</p>
<p>What connection do all of these images have with each other, you wonder? How could they all be of such importance? In truth, what <em>is</em> the secret of humans' success?</p>
<p>Hanging high above the exhibit, gigantic letters spell out the answer...</p>
