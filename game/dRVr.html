<p>"Annual percentage <em>yield</em>, or APY, is a little different from APR. They don't use APY on the Undergraduate Readiness Assessment, so I won't bore you with the details; just keep it in mind if you're ever out buying a car or something."</p>
<p>The bank manager pauses for a moment as if expecting you to ask a follow-up question, but you can't think of anything in particular you have questions about.</p>
<p>"Alright, that's compound interest. Commit that formula to memory since it's not on the formula sheet. Next, let's discuss probability."</p>
<p>"A <i>probability</i> is just a number from zero to one that describes how likely something is to happen. Zero means it's impossible, one means it's definitely going to happen, and 0.5 means it has a fifty-fifty chance. If I flip a coin, the probability of it landing on heads is one-half. If I two six-sided dice, the probability of getting snake eyes is about 0.03, or one divided by thirty-six. This is because there are thirty-six possible outcomes&mdash;six outcomes for the first die, six for the second, and you multiply them&mdash;and only one of them is snake eyes."</p>
