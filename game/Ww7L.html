<p>Examination Island Savings & Loan, which most people just call the Exam Bank for short, provides a wide variety of financial services to residents of the island. Customers can open savings accounts and take out loans as the name would suggest, but they can also trade stocks, get credit cards, and even store valuables in safety-deposit boxes.</p>
<p>After standing in line for a few minutes, you finally make it to the counter to talk to a teller. He says, "Welcome to Examination Island Savings & Loan! How can I help you?"</p>
<p>You're here because you'd like to learn more about mathematics and discuss how math is used in the financial industry.</p>
<p>"Uh, that's a little... broad. I'm not sure I can help you with that. Do you have an account with us?"</p>

<p>You ask to speak to his manager. The teller retreats into the back of the bank, and a few minutes later, the bank manager emerges. "You're studying for the URA, right? Sorry about that, he's new. How about we talk in my office?"</p>
