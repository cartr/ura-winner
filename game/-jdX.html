<p style="line-height: 16px;">The following is an abridged excerpt from a recent local news story.</p>

<blockquote>
<span id="lastsecret">Surprise</span> and mild amusement gripped the residents of Examination Island today as local police discovered a crate containing hundreds of rubber ducks at the bottom of Opportunity Bay.<br><br>
Police say they believe the crate fell out of a delivery truck during the Achievement Bridge disaster last month. No additional charges related to the ducks have been filed.<br><br>
Local fisherman Hardy Stevens says he's happy the source of the ducks has finally been located. "I'd been wondering where all those little guys came from; almost thought it was the PVC bait I was using!"<br><br>
The Environmental Committee reminds all residents to dispose of their trash in appropriate receptacles, not by dumping it into bodies of water.

                    The word "additional" serves to connect the two statements in the paragraph.
