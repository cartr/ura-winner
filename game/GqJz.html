<p>The following is a paragraph from a draft of a student's persuasive essay about transportation. It contains errors.</p>

<blockquote>
<em>[...]</em><br/>
Another reason why you should not drive a car is, that it is bad for the environment.
A report by <span id="secretlink">National Geographic</span> said, "Vehicles are bad, and you should feel bad if you drive one."
In other words, driving a car isn't a good idea.
You should feel bad if you drive a car.
You should use public transit instead of driving a car.
You should take the subway instead of driving a car.
You should stay home instead of driving a car.
I think this is a very important reason not to drive cars.
<br/><em>[...]</em>

                    <img src="resp_b.png" />
                    The third sentence implies that pollution only affects Americans, not people from other countries.

                    <img src="resp_c.png" />
                    The assertion made in the fourth sentence is not supported by the quote.

                    "I think" is not an appropriate phrase to use in the final sentence.
