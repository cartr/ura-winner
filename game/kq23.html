<p>All this science has made you a little thirsty, so you head for the food court to grab something to drink.</p>
<p>The museum's food court offers soft drinks in a regular cup 4 centimeters in diameter and 6 centimeters tall, and a novelty test tube 2 centimeters in diameter and 24 centimeters tall. You're really thirsty, so you ask the cashier which one's larger.</p>
<p>"You seem like a smart kid," he says. "Which one do you think?"</p>
<p>You think for a moment and then pull out your trusty URA Provided Formulas Sheet, which tells you that the volume of a cylinder is &pi; * r&sup2; * h. "Ah," you say, "I've got it..."</p>
