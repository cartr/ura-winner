<p>The bank manager's office seems pretty fancy. You sit down on a vaguely comfortable-looking sofa, and the bank manager sits across from you in an office chair.</p>
<p>"I suppose I should get the formalities out of the way first. Hello there, pleased to meet you, we're a bank, we offer savings accounts, and those savings accounts pay compound interest that accrues on a monthly basis. In other words, every month, we deposit a little extra money into your account, in an amount equal to about point one percent of your current balance.</p>
<p>"Now, say you want to figure out how much your account will be worth after some number of years. You'll want to use this equation..." He pulls out a notepad and scribbles something down on it:</p>
<blockquote>
<center><span id="secretlink">final value</span> = (initial deposit) * (1 + interest rate per period)<sup>(# periods)</sup></center>
</blockquote>
<p>"Most banks around here quote interest as "annual percentage rate", or APR, so assuming interest compounds monthly, you can just divide that by twelve to get the per-period rate. Oh, uh, and sorry if I'm being a little brief. We get a lot of kids like you this time of year."</p>
