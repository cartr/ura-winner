<p>"So, how's it going?" the man asks. "Feeling ready for the exam?"</p>

<p>There are still a few places on Examination Island you'd like to visit, but you're confident you'll be ready once you're done.</p>

<p>"Sure, sure. So you're here for, what, 'social studies'? They still sending kids to the etiquette school for that one? That instructor sure is a piece of work, I tell ya."</p>
<p>If you're being honest, you aren't sure you got the most you could out of your visit to the Etiquette School.</p>
<p>"Trust me, pal, no one does. But frankly, that part of the test is mostly just to make sure you're a decent person. Do you know how to order food at a restaurant, can you at least pretend to be considerate of other people, basic stuff like that. Either you've got it or you don't, and if you haven't gotten it by your age, you're probably a lost cause. I wouldn't worry about it either way."</p>
