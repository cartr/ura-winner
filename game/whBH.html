<h2>Practice Assessment</h2>

<p>You've had the opportunity to learn about all three sections of the URA: English, Math, and Social Studies. The residents of Examination Island you met really enjoyed your company, and they wish you luck in your studies!</p>

<p>It's now time to try another practice test to see how far you've progressed. Just like last time, this score is not an official judgement of the Assessment Committee and will not appear on your URA Score Report. Relax, take a deep breath, and try your best to apply the new skills you've learned.</p>
