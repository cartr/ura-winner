          <h2>The Theory and Practice of Etiquette</h2>
        
        
<p>"Ah, good afternoon, you must be another Undergraduate Readiness Assessment scholar; the Committee has been absolutely <em>flooding</em> us with you as of late..."</p>
<p>You've hardly made it through the front door of the Examination Island Etiquette School and someone has already started talking to you.</p>
<p>"...I've been an instructor at this institution for several years, and prior to my employment here, I had simply written off the youngest generation as self-absorbed, spoiled children in the same way many women my age seem to have, so I continue to be surprised by the number of students who enter our academy believing that etiquette is nothing more than a collection of old-fashioned, outmoded procedures for what were once routine interactions&mdash;although I do suppose the wrought-iron fence may contribute somewhat to a mistaken first impression in that particular area&mdash;and emerge having learned more than they've ever known about the intricacies of <em>courtesy</em> and <em>confidence</em>, two attributes that have truly come to the forefront in today's society, wouldn't you agree?"</p>

<p>Either you missed her name or the instructor forgot to tell you.</p>
