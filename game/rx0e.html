<h2>Practice Assessment</h2>

<p>We'll begin with a short preliminary assessment to see which areas you most need to improve on. Each section will have three questions and should not take more than five minutes to complete.</p>

<p>Your scores on this quiz will not be included on your URA Score Report; this quiz is for your benefit only. Relax, take a deep breath, and do your best.</p>
