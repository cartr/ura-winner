          <h2>Having a Good Time with Friends</h2>
        
        
<p>When you saw it on the map, you weren't really sure what kind of club the Good Times Club was. A nightclub? A comedy club? One of those school groups that collects money from the student council to spend on parties and gasoline? A stick you hit people over the head with if they aren't smiling enough?</p>
<p>You step inside and take a look around. It appears to be a bar of some sort; people are sitting on stools, drinking and talking to one another. How could a place like this possibly help you prepare for the Undergraduate Readiness Assessment, you wonder?</p>
<p>Suddenly, a man turns to you and his eyes light up. "Oh, hey! How's the exam stuff going?"</p>
<p>It's possible the two of you have met before, but you're having trouble remembering how or where.</p>
<p>"Aw, c'mon, you don't recognize me? From the alley outside the bookstore. Here, pull up a chair, get an orange juice for something, I dunno."</p>
